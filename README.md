# Weather_Dashboard

## Developer Notes

As a developer I was tasked with taking a third-party API's data to implenet in an application to display weather for multiple cities.

## Criteria

```
WHEN opening the application the user is displayed a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN the user searches for a city
THEN the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN the user views current weather conditions for that city
THEN the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN the user views the UV index
THEN user is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN user views future weather conditions for that city
THEN the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN the user clicks on a city in the search history
THEN the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
